# Anti-Sourceon Early Dark Energy Model

A physical model for resolving the Hubble tension via early dark energy from anti-sourceon particles.
The standard  CDM cosmological model is facing the severe challenge of the Hubble Tension ¨C a   discrepancy 
exists between the Hubble constant measured from the early universe (CMB) and the late universe (distance ladder). 
This paper proposes the "Circle-String-Bulk" cosmological model, which provides a unified solution to this problem 
by introducing the "anti-source particle" ( ) and its interaction phase transition occurring at redshift  . 
Based on geometric realism, relational ontology, and the cognitive simplification principle, and starting from the 
symmetry breaking of the "string singularity" ( ), the model derives through compulsory logical deduction that: 
before the phase transition, the anti-source particle interacts with the plasma through an energy barrier  , 
and its interaction energy manifests as Early Dark Energy ( ), elevating   to  ; after the phase transition, 
it becomes Cold Dark Matter. The model shows good agreement with Planck data ( ) and predicts  -DM coupling ( ), 
dynamical dark energy ( ), and primordial non-Gaussianity ( ), providing decisive tests for next-generation observations.

## Overview

This package implements the anti-sourceon early dark energy (EDE) model, which provides a physically motivated solution to the Hubble tension problem in modern cosmology.
