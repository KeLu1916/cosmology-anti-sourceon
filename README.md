# Anti-Sourceon Early Dark Energy Model

A physical model for resolving the Hubble tension via early dark energy from anti-sourceon particles.

## Overview

This package implements the anti-sourceon early dark energy (EDE) model, which provides a physically motivated solution to the Hubble tension problem in modern cosmology.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KeLu1916/cosmology-anti-sourceon.git
cd cosmology-anti-sourceon
pip install -e .
